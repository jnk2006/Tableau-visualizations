## About the dataset

<p>Child marriage is rooted in inequality between men and women and discriminatory views towards a girlâ€™s value, sexuality, and role in society. Ending child marriage is a strategic way of tackling gender inequality and shifting the discriminatory norms that perpetuate child marriage.
This week's Viz5 challenge aims to highlight the impact of child marriage.</p> <br>
